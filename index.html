		<p>Hello! I am Avaneesh Devkota, a second-year undergraduate student at New York University Abu Dhabi pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in Economics. A Kathmandu native with a passion for solving problems, I am committed to finding, and hopefully contributing to, the different ways technology can help make the world a better place.</p>
		<p>In my free time, you can find me losing my mind trying to solve <a href="https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/">Leetcode</a> problems, thinking, clicking photographs, writing, listening to podcasts, or cooking!</p><hr size = "1" noshade>
